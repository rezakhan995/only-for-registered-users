This plugin will force users to login before being able to view your site. Only registered and logged in users will be able to visit the content.

== Description ==

If you have a private post or page that you only want your registered members to read? Then you're at the right place. When active, this plugin will redirect all the users who aren't logged in to the login form window. On that login form, you can show custom user friendly message. This message is also customizable from the plugin settings. Not only that, this plugin also provides some additional settings, through which you can easily allow guests to access your site feeds directly or through REST API.

A very simple plugin with some powerful feature, isn't it?
